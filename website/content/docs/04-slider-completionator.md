Change the pixel length and the duration of sliders without having to deal with
SV. 

This tool works on the current map.

If require bookmarks is checked then the program will only target bookmarked
sliders. If it’s not checked then the program will work on every slider in the
current map.

Temporal length sets the duration of the slider in beats. If the textbox can’t
be parsed then it will not change the duration.

Spatial length sets the pixel length of the slider as a fraction of the
complete length of the path defined by the anchors. For example inputting 1
makes the slider go the complete path of the anchors and the sliderend will be
exactly on top of the last anchor. Inputting 3 makes for Pencilina sliders. If
the textbox can’t be parsed then it will not change the pixel length.
